## Introduction

A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. In web development, regex is widely used for tasks such as validating user input, searching and replacing patterns within strings, and parsing data.

## Summary

This tutorial covers the following regex patterns:

1. Anchors
2. Quantifiers
3. OR Operator
4. Character Classes
5. Flags
6. Grouping and Capturing
7. Bracket Expressions
8. Greedy and Lazy Match
9. Boundaries
10. Back-references
11. Look-ahead and Look-behind

Each regex pattern will be explained in detail, along with examples illustrating their usage.
